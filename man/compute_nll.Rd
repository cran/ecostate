\item{years}{Integer-vector of years included in model}

\item{noB_i}{Boolean vector indicating which taxa have no B value}

\item{type_i}{character vector indicating whether a taxon is "hetero", "auto", or
"detritus"}

\item{n_species}{number of species}

\item{project_vars}{function to integrate differential equation}

\item{DC_ij}{Diet projections matrix}

\item{Nobs_ta_g2}{formatted list of age-comp data}

\item{Wobs_ta_g2}{formatted list of weight-at-age data}

\item{log_prior}{A user-provided function that takes as input the list of
parameters \code{out$obj$env$parList()} where \code{out} is the output from
\code{ecostate()}, and returns a numeric vector
where the sum is the log-prior probability.  For example
\code{log_prior = function(p) dnorm( p$logq_i[1], mean=0, sd=0.1, log=TRUE)}
specifies a lognormal prior probability for the catchability coefficient
for the first \code{taxa} with logmean of zero and logsd of 0.1}

model should estimate annual process errors in dB/dt}

dynamics (called stanza-groups).}

}
\value{
The joint negative log-likelihood including contribution of priors
and fit to data.
}
\description{
Compute negative log-likelihood for EcoState model
}
\details{
Given a list of parameters, calculates the joint negative log-likelihood,
where the Laplace approximation is then used to marginalize across random
effects to calculate the log-marginal likelihood of fixed effects. The joint
likelihood includes the fit to fishery catches, biomass indices,
age-composition data, weight-at-age data, priors, and the distribution for
random effects.
