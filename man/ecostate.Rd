\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character vector of taxa included in model.}

\item{years}{Integer-vector of years included in model}

\item{catch}{long-form data frame with columns \code{Mass}, \code{Year}
and  \code{Taxon}}

\item{biomass}{long-form data frame with columns \code{Mass}, \code{Year}
and  \code{Taxon}, where \code{Mass} is assumed to have the same units
as \code{catch}}

\item{agecomp}{a named list, with names corresponding to \code{stanza_groups},
where each list-element is a matrix with rownames for \code{years}
and colnames for integer ages, where NA excludes the entry from inclusion
and the model computes the likelihood across included ages in a given year,
and the rowsum is the input-sample size for a given year}

\item{weight}{a named list, with names corresponding to \code{stanza_groups},
where each list-element is a matrix with rownames for \code{years}
and colnames for integer ages, where NA excludes the entry from inclusion
and the model computes the lognormal likelihood for weight-at-age
in each specified age-year combination}

\item{PB}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
ratio of production to biomass for each taxon}

\item{QB}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
ratio of consumption to biomass for each taxon}

\item{B}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
starting (or fixed) value for equilibrium biomass for each taxon}

\item{DC}{numeric-matrix with rownames and colnames matching \code{taxa},
where each column provides the diet proportion for a given predator}

\item{EE}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
proportion of proportion of production that is subsequently
modeled (termed ecotrophic efficiency)}

\item{X}{numeric-matrix with rownames and colnames matching \code{taxa},
where each element gives the vulnerability parameter for a given
interaction.}

\item{type}{character-vector with names matching \code{taxa} and
elements \code{c("auto","hetero","detritus")},
indicating whether each taxon is a primary producer, consumer/predator, or
detritus, respectively.}

\item{U}{numeric-vector with names matching \code{taxa}, providing the
proportion of consumption that is unassimilated and therefore
exported to detritus}

\item{fit_B}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which equilibrium
biomass is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_Q}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the catchability
coefficient is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_B0}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the ratio of initial
to equilibrium biomass is estimated as a fixed effect}

\item{fit_EE}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which ecotrophic
efficiency is estimated.}

\item{fit_PB}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which equilibrium
production per biomass is estimated.  Note that it is likely
a good idea to include a prior for any species for which this is estimated.}

\item{fit_QB}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which equilibrium
consumption per biomass is estimated.  Note that it is likely
a good idea to include a prior for any species for which this is estimated.}

\item{fit_eps}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the
model should estimate annual process errors in dB/dt}

\item{fit_nu}{Character-vector listing \code{taxa} for which the
model should estimate annual process errors in consumption \code{Q_ij}}

\item{log_prior}{A user-provided function that takes as input the list of
parameters \code{out$obj$env$parList()} where \code{out} is the output from
\code{ecostate()}, and returns a numeric vector
where the sum is the log-prior probability.  For example
\code{log_prior = function(p) dnorm( p$logq_i[1], mean=0, sd=0.1, log=TRUE)}
specifies a lognormal prior probability for the catchability coefficient
for the first \code{taxa} with logmean of zero and logsd of 0.1}

\item{settings}{Output from \code{\link[=stanza_settings]{stanza_settings()}}, used to define age-structured
dynamics (called stanza-groups).}

\item{control}{Output from \code{\link[=ecostate_control]{ecostate_control()}}, used to define user
settings.}
}
\value{
An object (list) of S3-class \code{ecostate}. Elements include:
\describe{
\item{obj}{RTMB object from \code{\link[RTMB]{MakeADFun}}}
\item{tmb_inputs}{The list of inputs passed to \code{\link[RTMB]{MakeADFun}}}
\item{opt}{The output from \code{\link[stats]{nlminb}}}
\item{sdrep}{The output from \code{\link[RTMB]{sdreport}}}
\item{interal}{Objects useful for package function, i.e., all arguments
passed during the call}
\item{rep}{report file, including matrix \code{B_ti} for biomass in each year
\code{t} and taxon \code{i}, \code{g_ti} for growth rate per biomass,
and see \code{dBdt} for other quantities reported by year}
\item{derived}{derived quantity estimates and standard errors, for \code{rep}
objects as requested}
\item{call}{function call record}
\item{run_time}{Total runtime}
}
This S3 class then has functions \code{summary}, \code{print}, and
\code{logLik}

\details{
All \code{taxa} must be included in \code{QB}, \code{PB}, \code{B}, and \code{DC},
but additional taxa can be in \code{QB}, \code{PB}, \code{B}, and \code{DC} that
are not in \code{taxa}.  So \code{taxa} can be used to redefine the set of modeled
species without changing other inputs
