\item{ytracer_i}{tracer to use when computing y-axis values}

\item{B_i}{biomass to use when weighting taxa in plot}

\item{taxa_labels}{character vector of labels to use for each taxon}

\item{xloc}{x-axis location (overrides calculation using \code{xtracer_i})}

\item{yloc}{y-axis location (overrides calculation using \code{ytracer_i})}

\description{
Plot consumption as a directed graph including all taxa (vertices)
and biomass consumed (arrows).  Taxa are located using tracers,
where by default the y-axis is trophic level.  #'
}
\details{
Trophic level \eqn{l_i} for each predator \eqn{i} is defined as:

\deqn{ \mathbf{l - 1 = l Q^*} }

where \eqn{\mathbf{Q*}} is the proportion consumption for each predator (column)
of different prey (rows).  We identify primary producers as any taxa with no
consumption (a column of 0s), and assign them as the first trophic level.
